	<p>In Uganda many young men,girls and some pastor who converted 
		<br>
		from Islam to Christianity lose their families, properties 
		<br>and their lives.The affliction and persecution arise from 
		<br>the parents, relatives those who are radical  muslims.
The Odeu Ministries has saved several lives from such instances and
		<br> currently we take care for 55 converts who are depending on
		<br> us and these ones have been severely injured and ,among which is,
		<br> Ibrahim, Shafiq,Musa Musitafas etc:

Musitafas Story:
</h4>
I am Mustafa, and I am a Christian. Formerly I was a Muslim, 
		<br>from a devoted Muslim family. I became a Christian in 2018, 
		<br>after I was convicted of my sin, and heard the truth of the Gospel 
		<br>of Jesus Christ. Preachers who came from Odeu Ministries in 
		<br>Africa(Uganda) were the ones who introduced me to Christ.
</p>
	<p>
	<h6 id="odeu">
My Agony of Pain:
</h6>
After I confessed Christ as Lord and Savior, I tried to hide the 
		<br>fact of being a Christian from my relatives,family and clan. 
		<br>After months I began sharing the gospel to my Mama and siblings,
		<br> and they later accepted Jesus Christ as well. However, I didn't know 
		<br>what would happen next if my Father and clan elders knew I had 
		<br>converted to Christianity, and had also convinced my Mother and siblings to convert.
</p>
	<p>

         In the 9th month, my Dad learned that I and my Mother had converted
		<br> from Islam. My Dad, Mr.****, had me beaten nearly to death. Afterwards, 
		<br>I was thrown into my room in my Father's house and left me there for somedays 
		<br>without food or drinking water. After  days had passed, my Father thought I 
		<br>would renounce Christ, but my faith had grown stronger. I was very weak 
		<br>and couldn’t even talk; but, when they asked me to renounce Jesus I refused  “No!”
		<br>.
My Father became furious, as did my Uncle and the Clan leaders.
		<br>
I was persecuted,tortured and afflicted beaten severely almost to death,and what pains 
		<br>me is,this was was done while claiming the name of Allah(Muslim God).
</p>
	<p>
My Mama saw my agony and tried to rescue me by called neighbors,and later the police came,
		<br> which didn’t help much because my Father all the relatives involved escaped,my 
		<br> Father  and Uncle hid themselves for several months.my case didn't go to the courts of law.
</p>
	<p>
Odeu Ministries and friends funded and they took me to the hospital. During that time My 
		<br>face had been severely wounded,I lost my left eye which was removed in the 
		<br>hospital because it had been damaged and was beyond cure.as shown in one of the photos.
</p>
	<p>

I have asthma, and just the memories of this horrible experience trigger attacks.
		<br> These attacks are so bad I have been hospitalized for them several times.
</p>
	<p>
After I was hospitalized for my first eye surgery operation and 
		<br> treating the severely damaged face in that healing process,Father returned 
		<br>home after hiding several months, my Mother and my siblings were
		<br>persecuted afresh,he was calling us KAFROON (meaning dis-believers or 
		<br>lost soul),In all this my mama  refused to denounce and renounce Jesus.
		<br> The clan elders tried to force them to denounce and renounce, but they wouldn’t do it.
		<br>
Finally my father threw us a way from his house.

Musitafas Habitation today:
</h6>
We moved from  northern Uganda, to Ugandas central region,it's along
		<br> distance away from my father's region,for security purposes.
		<br>
We took up residence in a dilapidated and utterly wretched house because we have nowhere else to go.
</p>
	<p>
	<h6 id="odeu">
Musitafa Healthy condition today!.
</h6>
IAM disabled now work  but I try to go and work as a cleaner at an 
		<br>Indian store, and earning 3000 Ugandan shillings (equivalent to $0.85) a day.
		<br> I can no longer attend school, and neither can my siblings. 
		<br>My siblings have not been able to go to school for the past one year.Odeu  Ministries
		<br> ( Food relief Department) has been helping us to get barely enough food and water to survive 
		<br>and medication for the nursing of my left Eye  which was damaged.
