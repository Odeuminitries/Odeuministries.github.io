CAUTION ABOUT:
THE ISLAMIC TAKE OVER OF  ONCE A CHRISTIAN  STATE.
<br>	
Who is to blame ?,Dear Christians wake up the evil is at the door way.
<br>
What happened to TURKEY  ?
	<br>
Turkey is in the present day Europe and partly in Asia.
	<br>
■Apostle Paul was a citizen of Turkey because Tarsus exists in Turkey.

■Christianity existed in Turkey for about 1,023 years while Christianity
	<br>has only existed in Nigeria and Ghana for 172yrs starting from when
	<br>Rev. Birch Freeman came to Badagry in 1842.

■The seven churches Jesus spoke to in Revelations 2 & 3
	<br>(Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea)
	<br>existed in the old Turkey.

■Turkey once had the largest Christian auditorium in Europe called Hagia Sophia
	<br>in Constantinople.

■Mary the mother of Jesus was taken to Turkey by Apostle John and till date, 
	<br>her room has become a tourist centre.
	</p>
<p>
PRESENT TURKEY TODAY;
■Present day Turkey has 96% muslims & 0.02% Christians(less than 130,000).
	
■The Hagia Sophia(once largest church in Europe) was taken over by muslims 
	<br>and converted to a mosque for over 400yrs and later used as an Islamic Museum.
(And today it's been turned to be amosque again)
	</p>
<p>
WHY CHRISTIANITY COLLAPSED IN TURKEY ?
	
■The Turks were building big cathedrals instead of building 
	<br>men and rooting them to the Depth into WORD OF GOD (BIBLE)

■Emphasis on doctrinal differences weakened the Turkish church 
	<br>instead of refuting  the lies which the Devil invaded and
	<br>sprang using the Islam Prophet (muhammad) who was a Murderer, 
	<br>pedophilia,liar and uneducated according to the Quran Surate 9:5 and 9:25.
	
■Then church completely weakened in vigorous spiritual prayer and
	<br>weakened in fellowship,The church compromised her powers  fearing
	<br>the political leaders threats of killing and jailing any christian .

■Rivalries amongst denominations due to false doctrinal teaching and not
	<br>following the teachings of the HOLY BIBLE causing many brothersand 
	<br>sisters joining occultism.

■Christian parents have given up on their spiritual 
	<br>child-training activities,Christian children don't know their 
	<br>God and can't defend their faith and thus they have ended up as
	<br>gay persons, atheist's,muslims etc.

■Petty politics in church coupled with ethnic biaseness,we all are believer
	<br>why black lives matter or white lives matter yet we all are one in Christ Jesus.
	</p>
<p>
HOW  DID THE TURKISH TAKE OVER HAPPEN ?

■Osman Ghazi discovered the disunity amongst Christians and used
	<br>it to fight a Jihad that led to a mass genocide of the Armenians,
	<br>the Hellen and Turks of that day. In fact, the weapon of war used
	<br>was designed by a Turkish Christian.

■Many Christian women converted to Islam to save their lives and some were
	<br>raped and killed.

■Osman Ghazi started the Ottoman empire which gave muslims political post
	<br>and made it a religion of the state.
	</p>
<p>
ARE YOU AWARE THAT:

1.)ENGLAND IS HEADING THE  TURKISH WAY ?
Who to blame for passively succumbed to the Muslim invasion?
	<br>
Mayor of London ... MUSLIM
	<br>
Mayor of Birmingham ... MUSLIM
	<br>
Mayor of Leeds ... MUSLIM
	<br>
Mayor of Blackburn ... MUSLIM
	<br>
Mayor of Sheffield ... MUSLIM
	<br>
Mayor of Oxford ... MUSLIM
	<br>
Mayor of Luton ... MUSLIM
	<br>
Mayor of Oldham ... MUSLIM
	<br>
Mayor of Rockdale ... MUSLIM.
		</p>
<p>
Over 3,000 Muslim Mosques
	<br>
Over 130 Muslim Sharia Courts
	<br>
Over 50 Muslim Sharia Councils
	</p>
<p>
Now UK is becoming Muslims-Only No-Go Areas for Christianity Across some parts of  UK.
	<br>
Muslim Women ... 78% don't work and are on  FREE benefits/housing.
	<br>
Muslim Men ... 63% don't work and are on FREE benefits/housing.
	<br>
Muslim Families 6-8 children planning to go on FREE benefits/housing.
	<br>
Now all UK schools are ONLY serving HALAL MEAT (meat dedicated to Islam god)and Arabic idols.
	</p>
<p>
All this achieved by just 4 million Muslims out of the 66 million population!!!
	<br>
This is an eye opening for all non-Muslims - .....   ..... Forward this if you are concerned!!!
	</p>
<p>
2).IS USA TAKING THE SAME PATH ?
	<br>
It has been estimated that there were somewhat more than 100 mosques in 
	<br>the U.S. in 1970, but immigration of more than a million Muslims since
	<br>then led to hundreds more being built. By 2000, there were 1,209 U.S.
	<br>mosques, which rose to 2,106 in 2010, an increase of 74%.
	</p>
<p>
3).NIGERIA/GHANA AND AFRICAN CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES ARE HEADING THE TURKISH WAY  ?
	<br>
■Virtually all the mistakes the church in Turkey made, is the same that the church in 
	<br>ENGLAND,USA,Uganda,Nigerian/Ghanaian churches is making today,DEAR church 
	<br>break the silence and compromise let's ACT NOW.
	</p>
<p>
■We are building Big Cathedrals at the expense of not discipling
	<br>men but preaching fantasy,promising wealth,miracles other than<br>
	making men to grow stronger in the WORD and the faith of our lord Jesus.
	</p>
<p>
■Disunity amongst churches.as church leaders are fighting for 
	<br>POSITION,HONOUR, WEALTH AND FAME.
	</p>
<p>
■Ethnicity in the church.
	<br>
■Denominational rivalry, etc.
	<br>
■Sharp division along doctrinal lines.
	</p>
<p>
*MORE FACTS*
	<br>
■The spiritual foundation of Turkey is stronger than 
	<br>that of Nigeria/ Ghana and Christianity existed for over 1000yrs 
	<br>in Turkey unlike in Nigeria and Ghana which is just 172yrs.
Islam Radicalism uprooted Christianity in Turkey. If it happened in Turkey,
	<br>if we don't wake up it can also happen in England,USA,Uganda,Nigeria/Ghana
	<br>and any other Christian state if we the christians don't wake up to preach 
	<br>the gospel of our lord Jesus Christ
	</p>
.<p>
■The menace of Boko Haram has destroyed a lot of churches in the
	<br>Northern Nigeria, and it may take another 200yrs to evangelize Borno State alone.
	</p>
<p>
■There is a secret agenda to Islamize Nigeria,Ghana, England, USA 
	<br>and other African nations as contained in Abuja declaration of 1989.
	</p>
<p>
	
*DON'T SAY IT CAN'T HAPPEN IT CAN HAPPEN , IF WE DON'T DO THE RIGHT THING AND WE DO IT NOW .
	<br>
SOLUTION :
	<br>
■HEART-FELT Intercession.
The prayer with the groaning of the Holyspirit.
	<br>
■Aggressive evangelism - the terrorist reached out to the youths 
	<br>in the Norths first and gave them AK-47 gun and bombs. lf we
	<br>had reached out to them on time, they'll be carrying BIBLES today.
■Mission support - God is holding the church responsible for ANTIFA,Boko 
	<br>Haram,ISLAM COMMUNITY OF ENGLAND, yet we are blaming the government. 
	<br>If we support missions and missionaries, we will have those insurgents to Christ long ago.
	</p>
<p>
■Unity of the church is key in winning this battle.
■Unity The last but not the least CHURCHES SHOULD WAKE UP
	<br>AND MAKE christians believers get actively involved in POLITICS. 
	<br>Enough of these Muslims, holding political offices with Islamic agenda.
	</p>
<p>
ARISE CHURCH & LETS DO THE NEEDFUL!
Please, send to Bishops, General Overseers, Pastors, 
	<br>Christian and all churches WhatsApp groups and all Christians on your contact list.
	<br>
May God bless you as you spread the word.
	</p>
	<p>
HOW DOES SAUDI ARABIC REJECT CHRISTIANITY ?
1.Imagine Currently there are no official churches in Saudi Arabia of 
		<br>any Christian denomination.
The small number of Christians in Saudi Arabia (which are all expats) meet
		<br>in internet chat rooms and private meetings.
	</p>
<p>
2.Saudi Arabia allows Christians to enter the country
	<br>as foreign workers for work or tourism, but does not allow 
	<br>them to practice their faith openly. Because of that Christians 
	<br>generally only worship within private homes. Items and articles belonging 
	<br>to religions other than Islam are prohibited.
	<br>
These include Bibles, crucifixes, statues, carvings, items with religious symbols, and others.
	</p>
<p>
The Saudi Arabian Mutaween (Arabic: مطوعين‎), or Committee for the Promotion of 
	<br>Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (i.e., the religious police) prohibits
	<br>the practice of any religion other than Islam.Conversion of a Muslim to
	<br>another religion is considered apostasy, a crime punishable by death 
	<br>if the accused does not recant.
	<br>
There have been no confirmed reports of executions for either crime in modern times.
	</p>
<p>
The Government does not permit non-Muslim clergy to enter the 
	<br>country for the purpose of conducting religious services.
	<br>In spite of this, a 2015 study estimates that there are some 
	<br>60,000 Christians with a Muslim background living in the country, 
	<br>though that does not mean that all of those are citizens of the country.
	</p>
<p>
Shocking how Muslims invade other countries but they can't allow Christianity in their own land. Is this Justice ?? is there freedoms of worship ??
<p>
You are the Church!
Let's work in love, the time is short.
